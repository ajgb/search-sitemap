Search-Sitemap
==================

The Sitemap Protocol allows you to inform search engine crawlers about
URLs on your Web sites that are available for crawling. A Sitemap con-
sists of a list of URLs and may also contain additional information
about those URLs, such as when they were last modified, how frequently
they change, etc.

The Search::Sitemap module allows you to create and modify sitemaps.
